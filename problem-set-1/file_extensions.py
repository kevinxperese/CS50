"""CS50P -- Problem Set 1: File Extensions
Source: https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/extensions/

Even though Windows and macOS sometimes hide them, most files have file extensions, a suffix that
starts with a period (.) at the end of their name. For instance, file names for GIFs end with .gif,
and file names for JPEGs end with .jpg or .jpeg. When you double-click on a file to open it, your
computer uses its file extension to determine which program to launch.

Web browsers, by contrast, rely on media types, formerly known as MIME types, to determine how to
display files that live on the web. When you download a file from a web server, that server sends an
HTTP header, along with the file itself, indicating the file's media type. For instance, the media
type for a GIF is image/gif, and the media type for a JPEG is image/jpeg. To determine the media
type for a file, a web server typically looks at the file's extension, mapping one to the other.

See developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types for common types.

In a file called extensions.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a file
and then outputs that file's media type if the file's name ends, case-insensitively, in any of these
suffixes:

.gif
.jpg
.jpeg
.png
.pdf
.txt
.zip

If the file's name ends with some other suffix or has no suffix at all, output
"application/octet-stream" instead, which is a common default.
